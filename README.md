# pig-playbehv-classification
This is the repository for the code developed for my master's degree in April 2022.

It contains code/packages for:
1. Data preprocessing (missing BBOX, BBOX expand, video length splitting etc.)
2. Video classification using CNN-LSTM (and its variants)
3. GradCAM visualization for 'attention' map
